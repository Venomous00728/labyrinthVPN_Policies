    <h1>LabyrinthVPN Privacy Policy Upated</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: May 9, 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>LabyrinthVPN is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our VPN service.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use LabyrinthVPN, we automatically generate a unique User ID (UUID) for each user. This UUID is used to establish and manage your VPN connection and does not contain any personally identifiable information. Additionally, we collect and store your public IP address in the app's shared preferences for the purpose of displaying it to you before establishing a VPN connection.</p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>The UUID and your public IP address are solely used for the purpose of providing our VPN service and ensuring a consistent user experience. We do not share, sell, or rent your UUID, IP address, or any other information to third parties for their marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. All VPN connections are secured using the WireGuard protocol, which provides strong encryption and privacy protection.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>LabyrinthVPN does not utilize any third-party services that may collect or process your personal information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy on our website or within the LabyrinthVPN app.</p>
